# Overview

Hi! My name is Joseph, and I wanted to use Pandas to analyze college basketball stats of 2023.

The data is taken from the 2023 NCAA college basketball season. Each division 1 conference is represented. The stats include offensive stats, defensive stats, power ratings, final standings, etc.

I wanted to see which conferences had the best shooting, and who in the Pac-12 did the best and worst at offensive rebounding, to see if that made a prediction of success on the season.

# Data Analysis Results

Q. Which conferences shoot the best?
A. Predominantly, the smaller schools and conferences take the top spots for both 2 and 3 point shooting percentage. This may be due to the fact that they cannot recruit as big and athletic defenders. But everybody can shoot in today's environment of "3 ball" and idolizing Stephen Curry and other great shooters of the Modern basketball scene.

Q. Do offensive rebounds gained and conversely given up correlate with winning in the Pac-12 conference?
A. No correlation was found. Those better rebounding teams could have few or many wins, and vice versa.

# Development Environment

I used VS Code

I used python, with the pandas and matplotlib libraries
